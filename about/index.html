  <h1> About Me </h1>  <br>
<p> Hi! I'm Alexandra, and I'm a graphic designer from the Bay Area. <br> <br>
  I'm currently studying Graphic Design and Advertising at San Jose State University.</p>

  <p> <ul> I love:  <br> * Science Fiction <br> * World Mythology <br> * Space Stuff <br> * Coffee <br> * Art <br>
    * Books <br>
  <p>  I love stories about stories, and I love creating anything and everything. Originally from Sonoma County, I grew up bilingual
    and had a lot of hobbies, including: theater, dance and ballet, I played the violin for a time, and was
    bookworm and a painter/artist.</p>
    <br>
    <p> I found my passion for design at 16-17 years old, and have only fallen in love more ever since. </p>
